# Recommendation System Overview

This repository contains a **Recommendation System** that employs multiple filtering techniques, including **Hybrid**, **Content-Based**, **Collaborative**, and **Context-Based** approaches, to recommend **music**, **movies**, **job roles**, and **mood-based music recommendations**. The system utilizes user preferences and contextual data to provide personalized and relevant recommendations. Below is a detailed breakdown of how each recommendation system works and the key technologies and skills learned during the development.

## Key Features

### 1. **Music Recommendation (Content-Based)**
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: This method recommends music based on the features of the items (songs). The system analyzes various attributes of the songs such as genre, tempo, instruments, and mood, and compares them to the user’s past preferences to make personalized suggestions.
   - **Music Feature Analysis**: The system extracts features like **genres**, **tempo**, **instrumentation**, and **lyrics** to build a profile of the user’s preferences.
   - **Personalization**: By analyzing user interaction history with different songs (like **listens**, **likes**, and **skips**), the system creates a **user profile** that helps make more accurate recommendations.

### 2. **Movie Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering)**
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Collaborative filtering recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users. This method identifies patterns in user behavior and suggests movies that users with similar preferences have liked.
   - **User-Item Interaction Matrix**: The system creates a matrix with users as rows and movies as columns, filling it with ratings or interactions. Similarity scores are computed to recommend movies to users.
   - **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering**: The algorithm uses either **user-based** or **item-based** collaborative filtering. The user-based method finds users similar to the target user, while item-based filtering finds items similar to those the user has interacted with.

### 3. **Mood-Based Music Recommendation (Context-Based Filtering)**
   - **Context-Based Filtering**: The system recommends music based on **contextual information**, such as the user’s **mood** or the **time of day**.
   - **Mood Detection**: The system incorporates **mood detection** models, such as sentiment analysis on text or the use of metadata from social media posts, to understand the user’s mood and recommend music that fits their emotional state.
   - **Time of Day**: Contextual data such as the **time of day**, **activity** (working, relaxing, partying), and **location** can influence the recommendations. For example, relaxing music might be recommended during evening hours, or energetic music during workout sessions.

### 4. **Job Recommendation (Hybrid Filtering)**
   - **Hybrid Filtering**: The hybrid recommendation system combines both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** approaches to recommend job roles. 
   - **Content-Based for Job Roles**: The system recommends jobs based on the user’s **skills**, **qualifications**, and **experience**. It matches these features against job descriptions to find the most relevant positions.
   - **Collaborative Filtering for Job Preferences**: The collaborative method looks at other users with similar profiles and their job preferences to suggest positions that they may like.
   - **Job Features**: The system takes into account job attributes such as **industry**, **skills required**, **location**, **salary range**, and **experience level** to personalize job recommendations.


## Skills and Technologies Learned

### 1. **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**
   - **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Learned how to handle and preprocess large datasets with missing or inconsistent data.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Focused on extracting relevant features such as song genres, movie categories, and job skills to build meaningful content-based recommendation profiles.
   - **Normalization**: Implemented normalization techniques for ensuring that input features (e.g., ratings, salary ranges) are on a comparable scale.

### 2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Implemented both **user-based** and **item-based** collaborative filtering algorithms, using **similarity measures** such as **Pearson correlation** or **cosine similarity**.
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Used machine learning techniques like **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for text-based features (e.g., movie descriptions, job descriptions) and **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** for similarity-based recommendations.
   - **Hybrid Systems**: Combined the strengths of **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** to improve recommendation accuracy.
   - **Context-Based Filtering**: Implemented mood detection through **sentiment analysis** and **time-based recommendations** using context-specific data like time of day or user activity.

### 3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Text Processing for Music and Job Recommendations**: Applied NLP techniques to process text-based data, such as job descriptions, song lyrics, and movie plots. Techniques like **TF-IDF**, **word embeddings**, and **sentiment analysis** were used.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Used **sentiment analysis** on user feedback and social media data to detect the user's mood for mood-based music recommendations.

### 4. **Evaluation and Model Tuning**
   - **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate the performance of the recommendation algorithms.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied grid search and cross-validation to fine-tune model parameters for better recommendation accuracy.

### 5. **Recommendation System Architecture**
   - **Matrix Factorization**: Used techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for collaborative filtering to decompose the user-item interaction matrix and discover hidden patterns.
   - **Recommendation Engine**: Built a recommendation engine that integrates collaborative, content-based, and context-based filtering methods to produce hybrid recommendations for the users.
   - **Real-Time Recommendations**: Leveraged **real-time user interactions** to dynamically adjust recommendations based on changing preferences or contextual data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for implementing recommendation algorithms and handling data processing.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing of large datasets.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models like KNN, SVD, and hybrid algorithms.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Used for text processing and sentiment analysis.
